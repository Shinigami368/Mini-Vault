MiniVault Bootstrap – Test Report

This document summarizes what was tested, what worked, and which optional features were partially or not tested. It is intended to show the evaluation reviewer the implementation status and limitations clearly.

✅ Core Components

 diagnose.sh – Tested successfully. Detected OS, Docker, GPU, NVIDIA drivers. Output written to both system_report.log and system_report.jsonl.
 run_inference_stub.sh – Successfully built and ran the container. Mounted input.json and generated output.json.
 entrypoint.sh – Simulated inference stub inside container. Created inference.jsonl with valid JSON log entry.
 Dockerfile – Works properly. Based on ubuntu:22.04, installs jq, curl, and sets up container with entrypoint.sh.
 input.json – Provided and used successfully.
 output.json – Created during inference run.
 inference.jsonl – Created by the container with mock inference log.

📝 Log Artifacts

 system_report.log – Human-readable system check.
 system_report.jsonl – JSONL-format structured version of above.
 inference.log – Captured stdout/stderr of container.
 inference.jsonl – Includes timestamped inference event.
 gpu_health.log – Logged GPU temperature and memory.
 gpu_health.jsonl – Structured version of GPU health logs.

🌟 Bonus Features

 GPU Health Monitor (gpu_health.sh) – Fully tested. Successfully ran nvidia-smi (WSL-compatible path), logs captured in .log and .jsonl.
 Mock Telemetry Server (telemetry_server.py) – Partially tested. Flask server installed and launched. POST logic written and documented in README, but actual log sending was only verified with curl sample, not fully integrated.
 Systemd Unit File (systemd/inference-stub.service) – Not executed due to systemd limitations in WSL. File was created correctly and documented in the README.

🚫 Not Fully Tested

 systemd activation and sudo systemctl start skipped. Commands were written and documented, but not executed.
 Telemetry POST requests: Not tested.
 Real model deployment: Not applicable, project intentionally uses a stub container.

🧾 Notes

 All shell scripts were normalized using dos2unix to ensure Linux compatibility.
 Docker required sudo to run properly in WSL and was executed accordingly.
 A temporary Python virtual environment was created for Flask, then deleted.
 Directory structure was organized into:
  systemd/ → system service unit
  telemetry/ → mock HTTP server
  test_results/ → all logs and outputs

Summary:

 All required components are implemented and tested. Optional features were included and either tested or documented with clear instructions. The project is fully functional in a local Linux (WSL) environment, simulating a minimal local AI deployment bootstrap.
